🐍 Snake-Water-Gun Game in Python 🎮 
A simple Python-based implementation of the classic Snake-Water-Gun game (similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors). The player competes against the computer over multiple rounds. Includes input validation, score tracking, and basic game logic using conditionals and random module.


## 📜 Game Rules

- Snake drinks Water → Snake wins 🐍💧
- Water drowns Gun → Water wins 💧🔫
- Gun shoots Snake → Gun wins 🔫🐍
- If both choices are the same → It's a draw 🤝

## 🧠 How It Works

- The user is prompted to input their choice: **Snake (s), Water (w), or Gun (g)**.
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- The winner is determined using the game rules.
- Scores are tracked and displayed after each round.
- At the end of the game, the final result is shown.
